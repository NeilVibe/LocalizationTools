# Deprecated - Inno Setup Files

These files were used for Inno Setup installer (deprecated 2025-12-14).

Replaced by electron-builder NSIS integration.

Reason: electron-builder NSIS is cleaner (single config in package.json) and same technology stack as VS Code, Slack, Discord.

Files:
- locanext_light.iss - LIGHT build installer script
- locanext_electron.iss - FULL build installer script  
- model_placeholder.txt - Placeholder for models directory
- redist/ - VC++ redistributable

See: locaNext/package.json for new NSIS config
