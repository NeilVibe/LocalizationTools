## 🎯 Manual UI Testing Required

### Why Manual Testing?
- Authentication is enabled on all API endpoints (production-ready security)
- Real user experience testing is more valuable than API curl tests
- WebSocket/task manager integration is best tested through UI
- Dashboard communication requires authenticated user session

### Test Data Ready
**Location:** `/home/neil1988/LocalizationTools/RessourcesForCodingTheProject/datausedfortesting/test123.txt`

**Contents:**
- 1,185 lines of Korean-French game localization
- Tab-delimited format (compatible with QuickSearch)
- Game: BDO (Black Desert Online)
- Language: FR (French)
- Contains StringIDs for lookup testing
