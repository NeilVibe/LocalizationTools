# QA Compiler Build Trigger
# Add a line "Build X" to trigger a build
# This is separate from GITEA_TRIGGER.txt (for LocaNext)
#
# Examples:
#   Build 1
#   Build 2.0.1
#
# Build is triggered by:
# 1. Adding a "Build X" line here
# 2. Changes to QACompilerNEW folder
# 3. Manual workflow_dispatch
#
# The version is auto-generated as MMDDHHMM (Korean time)
# unless specified in workflow_dispatch input.
