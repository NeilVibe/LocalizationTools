# Test Archive

This folder contains archived/deprecated tests that are no longer part of the active test suite.

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

- Preserves test history for reference
- May contain useful testing patterns
- Can be reactivated if needed
- Helps track test evolution over time

## Guidelines

1. Move tests here when they are:
   - Replaced by newer, more efficient tests
   - Testing deprecated functionality
   - Redundant with other tests

2. When archiving:
   - Add a comment at the top explaining why it was archived
   - Include the date of archival
   - Note what test replaced it (if applicable)

## Currently Archived
