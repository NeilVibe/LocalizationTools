Build Trigger File - LocaNext Electron Distribution
====================================================

USAGE:
------
Add a line with the build command, then commit & push to main.
GitHub Actions will automatically build when it detects the new line.

FORMAT:
  Build FULL v[version]  → Build Electron app with BERT model bundled

EXAMPLE:
  Build FULL v2511221939  → Builds Electron installer with 446MB BERT model

WORKFLOW:
1. Update VERSION in version.py (single source of truth)
2. Run: python3 scripts/check_version_unified.py
3. Commit version changes
4. Add build command to this file
5. Commit and push to main
6. GitHub Actions will automatically build

WHY MANUAL BUILDS?
- Control when releases happen (not every code commit)
- Save GitHub Actions minutes (Electron builds take ~15-20 min)
- Save LFS bandwidth quota (446MB model download per build)
- Intentional release process

LFS OPTIMIZATION:
- Electron build: lfs=true (needs model for bundling)
- Release job: lfs=false (only needs artifacts, saves bandwidth)
