## In Progress

### P13.11: FIX Gitea Windows Build "Job Failed" Bug

**Status: INVESTIGATING - Testing Fix #2**

**The bug:**
- Gitea builds complete successfully (ZIP created, all steps ✅)
- But act_runner reports "🏁 Job failed" at the very end
- This is a FALSE failure - the build actually works

**Investigation timeline:**

1. **Fix #1 (APPLIED):** Removed disabled `create-release` job
   - Had `if: false` + `needs: [build-windows]` causing dependency issues
   - Result: Still fails → issue is elsewhere

2. **Fix #2 (TESTING NOW):** Added `persist-credentials: false` to checkout
   - The post-job cleanup of `actions/checkout@v4` may be causing the issue
   - act_runner shows "Cleaning up container" even in host mode
   - `persist-credentials: false` reduces post-job work
   - Reference: [actions/checkout#1149](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/1149)

**Log analysis:**
```
✅  Success - Post Checkout code
Cleaning up container for job Build Windows LIGHT Installer  ← Host mode, no container!
🏁  Job failed  ← False failure during cleanup
```

## Recently Completed

### P13.10: Build Separation (2025-12-07) ✅

Separated GitHub and Gitea build triggers:
- GitHub: `BUILD_TRIGGER.txt` (production)
- Gitea: `GITEA_TRIGGER.txt` (local testing)

### P16: QuickSearch QA Tools (2025-12-06) ✅

5 QA endpoints + frontend tab for glossary checking.

### P15: Monolith Migration (2025-12-06) ✅

All 3 tools verified with production test files.

## Future Priorities

### P17: LanguageData Manager (CAT Tool)

Full-featured translation memory management:
- Import/Export TMX, XLIFF
- Fuzzy matching
- Term base integration

### P18: Platform UI/UX Overhaul

Modern UI redesign:
- Dashboard improvements
- Theme customization
- Keyboard shortcuts

### P19: Performance Monitoring

- Query optimization
- Memory profiling
- Load testing

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start servers
python3 server/main.py           # Backend (8888)
cd locaNext && npm run electron:dev  # Desktop app

# Testing
RUN_API_TESTS=1 python3 -m pytest -v

# Build (GitHub production)
python3 scripts/check_version_unified.py
echo "Build LIGHT vXXXX" >> BUILD_TRIGGER.txt
git push origin main

# Build (Gitea local test)
echo "Build LIGHT vXXXX" >> GITEA_TRIGGER.txt
git push gitea main
```

## Key Principles

1. **Monolith is Sacred** - Copy logic exactly, only change UI
2. **Backend is Flawless** - Never modify core without permission
3. **Log Everything** - Use `logger`, never `print()`
4. **Test with Real Data** - No mocks for core functions
5. **Version Before Build** - Run `check_version_unified.py`
